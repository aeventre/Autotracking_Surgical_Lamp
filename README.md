![3DCADSurgicalLAmp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/271425fb-fa0c-4cca-a45f-3e8320b62898)

This Repo is a work in progress at the moment. The project is in the Prototype stage. Below is the current setup of the Surgical Lamp

## Disclaimer
This Robot is ment for educational purposes at the moment. Please do not use this in a surgery room at this current time that would be unsafe.

## Software Design Overview

ROS2 Jazzy is being used as a framework for the lamp. Multiple packages are under development at the moment such as system_tests​, path_planner​, controller_coms​, pose_estimation​, command_manager​,
lidar_point_cloud_publisher​, camera_publisher​, gpio_publisher​, bluetooth_coms etc...

Also utilizing Gazebo Simulation to test lamp
